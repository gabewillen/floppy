# Every file

This rule applies to files no area rule covers, beside Open Code Review's
built-in checks.

## Rules for every file

floppy is a bot written entirely as SCXML documents, plus the Wasm packages
(extension namespaces under `namespaces/`, invoked services under
`services/`) those documents use. It has no runtime of its own: every bot runs
under scxml.rs's `scx run`, and the scxml.rs engine selects transitions and
runs macrosteps. `AGENTS.md` is normative (RFC 2119 MUST/SHOULD/MAY);
`docs/decisions.md` records each decision as `D<n>` and is cited by number.
Cite the AGENTS.md rule or decision a finding rests on.

- **No edits under `scxml.rs/`.** It is a squashed subtree; a change there goes
  upstream first and arrives only through `git subtree pull --squash`. Any
  hunk under `scxml.rs/` in an ordinary pull request is a defect.
- **No host code.** floppy adds no embedder, session loop, config format, or
  other runtime code; a capability a bot needs from the runtime is added to
  scxml.rs upstream. Code that selects transitions or mimics engine semantics
  is a defect.
- **Hard cutovers.** Pre-1.0, a replacement removes the old path, its tests,
  configuration and documentation in the same change. Flag compatibility
  shims, legacy fallbacks, "deprecated" aliases, or both paths left in place.
- **Idiomatic behavior, not ported artifacts.** floppy matches the behavior
  it ports, written idiomatically for SCXML, ECMAScript and Rust. Flag code
  that reproduces another language's implementation details instead of the
  behavior: mirroring Python or pydantic float formatting (`1.0` vs `1`),
  number-to-string shims that imitate `repr`, datetime formatting copied
  from a Python serializer when the schema only needs a valid timestamp, or
  helper names and structure carried over from Python. In ECMAScript, numbers
  are plain JS numbers. Python *tooling* (scripts under `scripts/`, test
  helpers, generators) is fine and is not a finding.
- **Wording in new text.** New code, comments, docs, schema descriptions,
  test names and commit-visible text MUST NOT name the upstream Python
  project the bot was ported from (the word `mosfet`, its module paths such as
  `src/mosfet/`) and MUST NOT describe behavior as "the original's" or "the
  reference's" ("as the original does", "the reference implementation",
  "matches the original"). State the behavior itself, and cite a decision
  (`D<n>`) for why. Only flag lines the diff adds or changes; existing text
  elsewhere is out of scope.
- **Terminology.** Use the repository's terms: *bot* (an SCXML document under
  `bots/<name>/`), *body* (the bot root, which only composes), *ability* (an
  invoked child document under `abilities/`), *environment* (the root session
  a bot runs in, `environments/<name>/`), *device* (a document an environment
  invokes, `devices/<name>/`), *namespace* (an executable-content extension
  package), *service* (an invoked-service package), *package* (a namespace or
  service with its manifest), *event contract* / *event schema* (an
  `event:schema` JSON Schema file). Domain event names (`bot.*`,
  `bot.ability.*`, `phone.*`) are kept byte for byte; flag a renamed or
  re-cased domain event.
- **Naming.** Concise domain names; no redundant `-component` suffix on
  crates, worlds or artifacts. Package identities are the exact tagless URIs
  `https://github.com/stateforward/floppy/namespaces/<name>` and
  `https://github.com/stateforward/floppy/services/<name>`.
- **Secrets.** Secret values are never printed, logged, formatted into
  errors, committed, or written into commands or documents
  (`--env NAME=VALUE`). Keys reach a run only through `scx --env-file`, and
  only `env`-slotted elements and `<invoke>`s receive them.
- **Tooling.** Never the `find` command in scripts or agent workflows; use
  `rg` and `ls`.
- **Scope.** A change is narrowly scoped and backed by a test matching its
  exact claim. Flag behavior changes with no test, and unrelated edits mixed
  into a change.
